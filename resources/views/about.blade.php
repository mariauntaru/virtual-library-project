            We are an amazing virtual library for everyone.
            On our book-lisk, you can scroll through and tap on any book you like, to see details about it, and to be able to borrow it.
            You can only borrow two books at a time, which you will see in the menu, in the section called "My books". The books are sent at the adress provided by you, or via email, depending on the personal preference. The book has to be shipped back to our adress, if you chose to have it delivered to your house, or it can be picked up by one of our associated couriers. We hope you find our book selection to your liking. Happy reading!
